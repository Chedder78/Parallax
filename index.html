            <p>We made our return to collecting GPK back in 2011 during the FlashBack Series release and continued to collect when we saw them throughout the years as they passed. Then the Facebooks groups began and we joined our first group in the summer of 2018. The first group we became members of was The Garbage Pail Kids Collective. Since then not only were we collecting a lot more at a rapid pace but also collecting crazy stories about other members. Some good, some bad, some ultimately hilarious and some even sound unbelievable but all true stories. We began our bootleg journey around 2019 right after the micro craze began with the Super Secret Fun Clubs Release of "What I could afford as a kid but I cant afford now" micro GPK OS1 box with micro packs inside and sealed like a shrunken version of the real thing. climbing in the hundreds until topping out around $1,000 for the micro cardback, we realized that buying one was no longer an  option. Thats when we were told to make our own and so we did. We now have every series available from OS1 to OS16. In 2 different sfyles. Full sets, 12 packs, placed inside its micro version of a OS box, sealed under a blister onto a custom card back design to represent the corresponding series inside. The second type we have available are the modernized versions of each series if it were made into a blaster box. 5 wax packs per blaster box, placed in a snap closing plastic clam shell with a custom made label to represent the series it's from. meticulous detail and intricate designs with every box.</p>
